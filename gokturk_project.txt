PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Please create a JSON API to manage a car catalogue and their safety ratings. You should have two tables, "cars", "ratings".

A car has the following features:
"ID" (A unique id for each entry)
"Make" (Ford, Opel etc.)
"Model" (Focus, Astra, etc.)
"Trim" ("1.6", "1.4 turbo", "FR", "SLX" etc.)
"Year" ("2019", "2020" etc.)
"Created At Date & Time" - when this car is recorded to the system

A rating has the following properties:
"Car ID"
"Rating Agency Name"
"Rating" - 0.0 to 10.0

For example, agency named "Euro NCAP" may rate Ford Focus 1.6 (2020) as 7.7
						"India NCAP" may rate the same car with 8.0

Using this API, customer should be able to create cars and ratings.

Using this API, customer should be able to make changes to previously created cars.
For example, Trim name can be changed from "1.6" to "1.6 TDI". Every property except ID can be changed.

Ratings can not be changed.

Cars and ratings can be deleted. If a car is deleted, every rating of that car should be automatically deleted.

Please watch for invalid data, a car must have a model name, it can not be an empty string etc. 
The API should return related HTTP status codes for these types of errors.

The Database should be MySQL. Please use appropriate MySQL data types.

Please put the developed code to your GitHub account and share with us.
